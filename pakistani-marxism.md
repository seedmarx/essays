# Pakistani Marxism
A list of resources for Marxists and Marxist analysis of Pakistan.
You'll find that many of these works are from Taimur Rahman, a Pakistani Marxist-Leninist who is the General Secretary of the Mazdoor Kissan Party, teacher, and head of the band Laal, who sign anti-capitalist, socialist songs.

Honesty his entire YouTube channel has a multitude of these videos that are all great, so I'll be putting a few particulary good ones on here. Putting all of them on here would make the list too long. They are primarily aimed at a Pakistani audience who are unfamiliar with Marxism and socialism (with the exception of the first work below). Note that some of these are in Urdu.
