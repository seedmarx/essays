# Pakistani Marxism
A list of resources for Marxists and Marxist analysis of Pakistan.
You'll find that many of these works are from Taimur Rahman, a Pakistani Marxist-Leninist who is the General Secretary of the [Mazdoor Kissan Party](http://pmkp.pk/events-2/), teacher, and head of the band Laal, who sing anti-capitalist, socialist songs.

## Books
- Taimur Rahman - [*The Class Structure of Pakistan*](https://www.amazon.com/Class-Structure-Pakistan-Taimur-Rahman/dp/0199065071/) (Book)
- Taimur Rhaman - [The Class Structure of Pakistan](https://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/Seminar/Class_Structure_of_Pakistan.pdf) (Presentation): This is a **presentation** listing the basic points of the book above.

## Videos
- Luna Oi  & Taimur Rahman - [Interview with Pakistan Communist Party General Secretary Taimur Rahman](https://youtu.be/TGXjptBzUHQ): This one is especially great, this is perfect for learning about the Left in Pakistan and Pakistan as a whole. Watch this one first.

- Taimur Rahman - [Pol Econ of Pakistan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOV7ykEqGK1ZKUmhdAktOBq0f9gtP12vi): An excellent playlist regarding the economy of Pakistan.


Honestly, his entire [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIyAy8lIQwnj-2CGt9e-N3g) has a multitude of these videos that are all great, so I'll be putting a few particulary good ones on here. Putting all of them on here would make the list too long. They are primarily aimed at a Pakistani audience who are unfamiliar with Marxism and socialism (with the exception of the first work below). Note that all of these are in Urdu, however some videos on his channel are in English or have closed captions.
